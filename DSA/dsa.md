## Introduction

**Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** form the backbone of computer science and are critical for problem solving, efficient programming, and technical interviews. Mastering DSA:
- Improves code efficiency and scalability.
- Prepares you for internships, jobs, and tech interviews.
- Makes you a stronger software engineer in any field.
